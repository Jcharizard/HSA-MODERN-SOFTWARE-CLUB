# HSA Modern Software Club | Leadership & Curriculum Portfolio

![HSA Modern Software Club Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1280x320/282c34/61dafb.png?text=HSA+Modern+Software+Club)

Welcome to the official repository for the HSA Modern Software Club. I am [Jhonny Alvarado], the founder and president of this initiative. This repository serves as a living document and portfolio, detailing the club's mission, curriculum, meeting structure, and my leadership role in fostering a new generation of student developers at [Pierre Barbaglia Shaheen Highschool].

After the previous computer science club became inactive, I identified a strong student desire for a practical, project-focused, and modern coding club. I founded this club in Fall 2023 with a mission to teach not just code, but how to think, problem-solve, and build like a modern software engineer.

## üöÄ Club Philosophy: The Architect & The AI

Our curriculum is built on a core philosophy: **"Be the Architect, not just the Bricklayer."**

*   **The Architect (Our Focus):** We emphasize the high-level skills of software architecture: creativity, logical reasoning, project planning, and debugging. Students learn to take an idea from concept to a structured plan. This is the most valuable and durable skill in technology.

*   **The Bricklayer (Our Tool):** We leverage modern tools, including AI code assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI IDE, and Replit AI, to handle complex syntax and accelerate the building process. This is **AI-Augmented Learning**.

This approach teaches students to be efficient, resourceful problem-solvers who focus on the "why" behind the code, preparing them for the realities of the modern tech industry where productivity tools are standard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Accessibility

A core tenet of the club is 100% accessibility, ensuring any student with a school-issued Chromebook can fully participate.

*   **Primary IDE:** **Replit** - A browser-based IDE that requires no installation and provides a robust environment for web development, Python scripting, and more.
*   **AI Assistants:** **Replit AI** & **Cursor** (for students with personal machines) - Used as teaching aids to explain code, generate boilerplate, and debug errors.
*   **Version Control:** **Git & GitHub** - Students are encouraged to save their work to their own GitHub profiles, building their personal portfolios from day one.
*   **Collaboration:** **Google Workspace** (Slides, Docs) & **Discord** - Used for curriculum planning, announcements, and peer-to-peer help outside of meetings.

## üíº Leadership & Impact

As founder and president, my responsibilities extend beyond teaching code.

*   **Curriculum Design:** Developing and structuring a comprehensive, project-based curriculum suitable for a wide range of skill levels.
*   **Mentorship:** Providing one-on-one guidance during meetings, helping students debug code and structure their project logic, bridging the gap between an idea and its execution.
*   **Community Management:** Fostering an inclusive, collaborative, and energetic environment. Grew club attendance from 0 to **15+ active members** in the first meeting.
*   **Logistics & Administration:** Liaising with school faculty to secure resources (classroom space, faculty sponsorship) and managing all club communications.

This experience has been invaluable in honing my skills in technical communication, project management, and leadership.
